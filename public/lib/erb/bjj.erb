  <h1>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h1>

    <p>I started training BJJ when I moved to the UK. I had my first session in 2014 and I've been training ever since. It's a very different world to Muay Thai but it's equally adictive.</p>

  <p>I've trained at a variety of different gyms due to locational constraints. Moving jobs and home is all the more difficult when you become assimilated into a particular gym. It feels like starting over again.</p>

  <p>At Andy Roberts I worked hard with the guidance of the world class instructors and students alike. Then in the summer of 2015 I recived my Blue Belt. This essentially meant that anywone who was taking it easy on me during training no longer did so. In spite of that it was a proud moment.</p>

  <p>Just after receiving my blue belt I had a competition which was a great learning experience. I made a number of stupid mistakes which I haven't made since; so overall I was happy with the progress.</p>
